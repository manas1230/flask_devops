# CI/CD pipeline using Flask machine learning app

# Overview of the project
Sklearn model has been trained to predict housing prices in Boston according to several features, such as average rooms in a home and data about highway access, teacher-to-pupil ratios, and so on. This project operationalizes a Python flask appâ€”in a provided file, app.py that serves out predictions (inference) about housing prices through API calls. I have used Azure pipelines for continuous deployment.

# Instructions for running the Python project

I have set up continuous integration using github to test the make/requirements files. The make test pass wihtout any error (also confirmed with YAML file in github actions)

Below is a screenshot of cloning the git repo in azure cloud shell before moving on to the main flask project.

Next, An azure webapp service is launched to host the flask machine learning app as shown below.

After the web app launched successfully,

A Linux virtual machine was created to be the agent to handle the deployment in Azure devops.

The Azure pipelines uses a self hosted feature by making use of the git repo to automatically build the YAML file. This YAML file/script builds and deploys the app into our webapp.

This is a successfull prediction after deploying the flask app

I have also run locust load tests with 10 users

# Project improvements
This project could be extended to any pre-trained machine learning model, such as those for image recognition and data labeling. Also the model could be improved.
